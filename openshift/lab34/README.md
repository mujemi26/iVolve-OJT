# Kubernetes: Taints, Tolerations, and Node Affinity ‚ú®

Welcome to the **Kubernetes Taints, Tolerations, and Node Affinity** repository! This document explains these Kubernetes concepts with clear examples and use cases. Let's dive in! ‚ö°Ô∏è

---

## Overview ‚úÖ

- **Taints:** Restrict which pods can be scheduled on a node by applying rules.
- **Tolerations:** Allow pods to bypass taint restrictions.
- **Node Affinity:** Guide pods to schedule on specific nodes based on labels.

These concepts work together to control **where and why** workloads run in your Kubernetes cluster.

---

## Taints ‚õî

Taints ensure that **no pods are scheduled on a node** unless they explicitly tolerate the taint. This is useful for:

- Reserving nodes for specific workloads.
- Temporarily isolating nodes for maintenance.
- Blocking pods from being scheduled on underperforming nodes.

### How to Apply a Taint

```bash
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:NoSchedule
```

### Example

```bash
kubectl taint nodes kind-control-plane environment=production:NoSchedule
```

This taint ensures that only pods tolerating `environment=production` are scheduled on the node.

---

## Tolerations üîí

Tolerations allow pods to **ignore specific taints** and run on tainted nodes. They are defined in the pod's YAML file.

### Example Pod with Tolerations

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: toleration-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
  tolerations:
    - key: "environment"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "production"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
```

This pod can run on nodes tainted with `environment=production:NoSchedule`.

## Node Affinity üìä

Node Affinity is used to **guide pods** to specific nodes based on their labels. It has two types:

- **Required (hard constraint):** Pod must run on nodes with matching labels.
- **Preferred (soft constraint):** Pod tries to run on matching nodes but can run elsewhere if none are available.

### Example Pod with Node Affinity

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: affinity-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
              - key: "disk-type"
                operator: "In"
                values:
                  - "ssd"
```

This pod can only run on nodes labeled with `disk-type=ssd`.

## Comparison Table üåê

| **Feature**       | **Taints**                            | **Tolerations**                          | **Node Affinity**                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**       | Restrict nodes to specific workloads. | Allow pods to bypass taint restrictions. | Guide pods to specific nodes based on labels. |
| **Scope**         | Applied to nodes.                     | Applied to pods.                         | Applied to pods.                              |
| **Configuration** | `kubectl taint nodes`                 | `spec.tolerations` in pod spec.          | `spec.affinity.nodeAffinity` in pod spec.     |
| **Use Cases**     | Reserve nodes, isolate workloads.     | Deploy pods on restricted nodes.         | Run pods on nodes with specific features.     |

## How to Untaint a Node üîÑ

To remove a taint from a node:

### Check Existing Taints

```bash
kubectl describe nodes <node-name> | grep Taints
```

### Remove a Taint

```bash
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key:effect-
```

### Example

```bash
kubectl taint nodes kind-control-plane environment=production:NoSchedule-
```

---

## Use Cases üî¨

### 1. Reserving Nodes for Specific Workloads

- **Taints & Tolerations:** Restrict nodes to high-priority or resource-intensive workloads.

### 2. Scheduling Pods Based on Node Capabilities

- **Node Affinity:** Ensure pods run on nodes with specific hardware (e.g., GPUs, SSDs).

### 3. Isolating Nodes for Maintenance

- **Taints:** Temporarily block workloads during maintenance.

## Try It Out üöÄ

1. Create a Kind cluster:
   ```bash
   kind create cluster
   ```
2. Apply the provided examples for Taints, Tolerations, and Node Affinity.
3. Test and observe how pods are scheduled in your cluster.
